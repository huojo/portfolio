Purpose of the file:
â€¢	Prepare a directory for a neural network. Moves away pictures that are too small (not to delete, but its own trash directory), resizes images, finds pictures with only 1 face in them
and checks that one face for face landmarks. Based on that, the pictures are moved to keep or delete directories.
